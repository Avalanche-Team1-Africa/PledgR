# Avalanche Adamur NOC Smart Contracts

This repository contains smart contracts and scripts for the Avalanche Adamur NOC project, built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)â€”a blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

## Overview
This codebase provides a modular registry for creators, staking, and perks on Avalanche, with extensible smart contracts and a robust testing/deployment pipeline using Foundry.

## Contracts
- **CreatorRegistry**: Register, update, and manage creator profiles on-chain. Each creator has metadata (name, bio, avatar), activity status, and stats (total staked, fan count, creation time).
- **Staking**: (WIP) Staking logic for fans to support creators.
- **Perks**: (WIP) Perks and rewards for fans and creators.

Contracts are located in `contracts/`.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (forge, cast, anvil)
- Node.js (for front-end or integration scripts)

### Install Dependencies
```sh
forge install
```

## Development

### Build Contracts
```sh
forge build
```

### Format Code
```sh
forge fmt
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```sh
forge test
```

### Gas Snapshots
```sh
forge snapshot
```

## Local Blockchain

### Start Local Node
```sh
anvil
```

## Deployment

### Deploy CreatorRegistry Locally
1. Start Anvil in a terminal:
   ```sh
   anvil
   ```
2. Deploy contract using Foundry script:
   ```sh
   forge script script/DeployCreatorRegistry.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
   ```
   Replace `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with one from Anvil output.

## Interacting with Contracts

### Using Cast (CLI)
- Register a creator:
  ```sh
  cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "registerCreator(string,string,string)" "Alice" "My bio" "https://avatar.url" --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
  ```
- Fetch creator profile:
  ```sh
  cast call <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "creators(address)" <YOUR_ADDRESS> --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
  ```
- Update profile:
  ```sh
  cast send <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "updateProfile(string,string,string)" "Alice2" "New bio" "https://avatar2.url" --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
  ```

### Using Node.js (Ethers.js)
See `testCreatorRegistry.js` for example integration scripts.
